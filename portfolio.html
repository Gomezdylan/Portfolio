                        This is my pong project. It was designed using C# in Unity. Using Colliders and Tags I was able 
                        to use a monobehaviour script to recreate the classic game. For my game there was an unlosable mode 
                        for new players so they could practice the game.

                        This is my "College Basketball Statpad". This game took all the learning I had on python and web scraping to make 
                        a stats themed project on college basketball. Once I learned how to scrape the data I turned it into a csv file which
                        I could easily manage to find data like highest scorers. After this I made an interactive interface for users to see 
                        the data I used.
