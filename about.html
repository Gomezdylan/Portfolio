        <p style="width: 45%; font-size: 18px;">My name is Dylan Gomez, and I am a junior at the University of Idaho pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about
            technology abd problem-solving, and I am currently focused on gaining experience in the field through an internship or job opportunity
            by this upcoming summer. I enjoy applying what I have learned in class to real-world projects, and I am motivated by the chance
            to contribute to meaningul work in the tech industry.

            Outside of academics, sports have always been a huge part of my life. I enjoy playing all sports, but tennis and basketball 
            always seemed to be my favorite. I believe sports shaped me with teamwork, discipline, and making meaningful connections in life.
            I am also a active member of Sigma Chi, where I've built strong leadership and communication skills. The house has shaped me 
            into being the man I am today, and I can only be greatful for what I have learned from my brothers and alumni.

            I was born and raised in Idaho and graduated from Lewiston High School. No matter where I go next, I bring with me a strong work ethic,
            determination, and a genuine drive to improve the people and places around me. My goal is not only to grow as a computer scientist
            but also to make a positive impact wherever I land.
